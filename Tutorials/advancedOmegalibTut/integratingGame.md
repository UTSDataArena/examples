# Hands On: Integrating a game into omegalib 

In this section, we will show a few common problems arising, when integrating highly interactive applications such as games. We will show the solution to these problems in the context of integrating a game using osg and bullet physics, called Troen. For source reference and more in-depth examples of integrating a fairly advanced osg application into omegalib, you can find the source of the game on [github](https://github.com/MaxReimann/Troen).
