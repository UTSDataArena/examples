(insert the pic from the livre github.io page)

Livre (Large-scale Interactive Volume Rendering Engine) is an out-of-core, multi-node, multi-gpu, OpenGL volume rendering engine to visualise large volumetric data sets. It is not included in the Virtual Machine but is easily installed from source on Linux. To try it out, git clone the source from https://github.com/BlueBrain/Livre. Follow the [installation steps](http://bluebrain.github.io/Livre-0.7/_user__guide.html) and read about the usage of the tool there.

The TuvokDataConverter is a tool to bring volume data into the format of Livre, you can read about the conversion workflow on the [livre docs](http://bluebrain.github.io/Livre-0.7/_tuvok__tool.html) . The tool [source](https://github.com/BlueBrain/TuvokDataConverter) does not compile out of the box on some platforms, however it is installed in the DAVM for convenient use.
